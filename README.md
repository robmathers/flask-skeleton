# Flask Skeleton

This is a basic skeleton of a Flask application, for use as a quick starting point to get to a useful database-backed Flask app.

It's largely based off of [Miguel Grinberg's "Flask Mega-Tutorial"][tutorial], with a few modifications, and stripped down to the simplest possible starting point, while still keeping the useful pieces (specifically blueprints for a sane project structure).
